# heli-gym 🚁
OpenAI GYM environment for 6-DOF Helicopter simulation.

This is GYM environment package for reinforcement learning for helicopter flight tasks using minimum complexity helicopter model.

For a fresh Linux clone, install the native build dependencies first (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libglfw3-dev libassimp-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
bash ./setup_install.sh
source ./init.sh
python test.py
```

`test.py` opens an OpenGL window, so it also requires a graphical session or
working display forwarding.

-------------------------------------
## __Environment Details__

* Pure Gym environment
* Realistic Dynamic Model based on Minimum Complexity Helicopter Model ([Heffley and Mnich](https://robertheffley.com/docs/Sim_modeling/Heffley-Mnich--Minimum-Complexity%20Helicopter%20Simulation%20Math%20Model--NASA%20CR%20177476.pdf))
In addition, inflow dynamics are added and model is adjusted so that it covers multiple flight conditions. 
* Rendering is done by OpenGL.

Aircraft, terrain, and weather defaults are stored independently under
`heligym/envs/config/helis`, `heligym/envs/config/terrains`, and
`heligym/envs/config/weather`.
`Heli` accepts either bundled configuration names or YAML paths for the
aircraft and terrain. Weather and atmospheric values are constructor arguments:

```python
env = heligym.Heli(
    heli_name="aw109",
    terrain_name="default_terrain",
    wind_direction=45.0,       # degrees
    wind_speed=20.0,           # ft/s
    turbulence_level=1,
    gravity=32.2,              # ft/s²
    render_mode=None,
)
```

The other physical arguments are `gas_constant`, `sea_level_temperature`,
`temperature_lapse_rate`, `troposphere_height`, and
`sea_level_air_density`. Their defaults are defined in
`default_weather.yaml`.

At reset, the previous controls are the trim controls used to create the
initial steady-flight state. After each step, they are the direct controls
most recently supplied by the agent.
-------------------------------------
## __Tasks__
For now only one task is available. However, rewarding is not tested well yet.

| Environment           | Details              |
|--------------------   |----------------------|
| HeliHover-v0          | Hover                |
| HeliForwardFlight-v0  | Forward Flight       |
| HeliObliqueFlight-v0  | Oblique Flight       |

-------------------------------------
## __Tested OS__
Environment tested on these OSs. If you have any problem, probably shared libraries for rendering 
make it, please look at [renderer page.](heligym/envs/renderer/README.md)

Environment should be run at least 100 FPS to simulate helicopter precisely. 
Receiving max FPS with NVIDIA 1070-TI with Intel i7-8700K given in the table. Limiting factor of FPS is CPU because of calculation of dynamics of helicopter in Python. If system cannot reach 100 FPS, please make sure that GPU driver be installed and make sure that CPU can handle with the Python.

| Tested OS      |  Max FPS |
|----------------|----------|
| Windows 10     |    350   |
| Ubuntu 18.04   |    470   |
| Ubuntu 16.04   |    500   |

For the user who has lower than the version of Ubuntu 16.04 (like Ubuntu 14.04 etc.) or other Linux distros, 
please re-compile dependent libraries. Re-compile instruction can be found at [renderer page.](heligym/envs/renderer/README.md)

-------------------------------------
## __Project Structure__

The repository is organised in layers: the Gymnasium-facing environments coordinate a reusable Python dynamics model, while rendering is isolated behind a Python API backed by a native C++/OpenGL library. Configuration and visual assets live next to the subsystem that consumes them, and tests mirror the behaviours they verify.

```

This separation keeps reinforcement-learning tasks independent from the equations of motion: new tasks normally belong in `helicopter_with_tasks.py`, new aircraft are described under `helis/`, and changes to flight physics stay in `dynamics/`. Rendering remains a self-contained subsystem, and `api.py` shields environment code from the lower-level `ctypes` and C++ implementation. Generated caches and virtual environments are intentionally omitted from the tree above, while assets and bundled third-party dependencies are grouped rather than listing every generated or upstream file.

-------------------------------------
## __Setup__
Install the package directly with pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, source the guided installation script. It uses `uv` to create a local `.venv` and install the package:

```bash
source setup_install.sh
```

-------------------------------------
## __Usage__
For a quick start after using the guided installer, activate its virtual environment and run the interactive example:

```bash
source init.sh
python test.py
```

To use heli-gym in your own code, create an environment with either:

```python
from heligym import HeliHover
env = HeliHover()
```

or:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import heligym
env = gym.make("HeliHover-v0")
```

The rest is usual as of any GYM environment !
